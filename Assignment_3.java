// Title : Scenario: Emergency Relief Supply Distribution
// A devastating flood has hit multiple villages in a remote area, and the government, along

// with NGOs, is organizing an emergency relief operation. A rescue team has a limited-
// capacity boat that can carry a maximum weight of W kilograms. The boat must transport

// critical supplies, including food, medicine, and drinking water, from a relief center to the
// affected villages.
// Each type of relief item has:
// ● A weight (wi) in kilograms.
// ● Utility value (vi) indicating its importance (e.g., medicine has higher value than food).
// ● Some items can be divided into smaller portions (e.g., food and water), while others must
// be taken as a whole (e.g., medical kits).
// As the logistics manager, you must:
// 1. Implement the Fractional Knapsack algorithm to maximize the total utility value of the
// supplies transported.
// 2. Prioritize high-value items while considering weight constraints.
// 3. Allow partial selection of divisible items (e.g., carrying a fraction of food packets).
// 4. Ensure that the boat carries the most critical supplies given its weight limit W.
